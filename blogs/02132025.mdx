# New Project: [gratitudeatsevenpm.com](https://gratitudeatsevenpm.com)

This idea is incredibly simple. Everyday at 7pm PST, the site clears all the gratitude messages from the previous day and people are notified to think about and write what they are grateful about.
But, I think the best part about it is the gratitudes board that, actually, one of my friends recommended. If you post, or even if you don't post, you can see what people around the world are grateful about.

Currently, it clears the database everday at 7pm PST but I would want to add this to be specific per timezone and then people could see what their timezone is greatful about.
Another idea that could branch off of this is showing a map and describing the most popular thing that people around the world are grateful for.

What if I made it into an app? Then instead of having to type the website, a person could download this relatively-lightweight app and get a fun notification everyday at 7pm instead.

I'm passionate about the potential of the idea but I want to push myself to learn how to really promote an app. I saw some creators on X, especially [@nikitabier](https://x.com/nikitabier) and he knows something about marketing that I admire.
It's one thing to make something that people want, but it's more impressive to build that and then promote so well that your target audience finds it. So far, I know countless stories about people finding success on Hacker News; there's been countless cool projects that I found on X.
I don't want to just promote it as a story post on Instagram, but Reels have good traction. Hmmm...

This would be a cool thing to research into. I could look big projects and companies and really analyze how they started. I can find what their unique breakthrough was. Maybe I can write about it too.

Anyways, try out [gratitudeatsevenpm.com](https://gratitudeatsevenpm.com) I think we could make a really wholesome community out of that.
